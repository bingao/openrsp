## Definitions, standards and guidelines for authorship 

* An author of OpenRSP is a "joint author" as that term is defined in [1] (see [2] for further information).

* Also recognized is the status of "contributor", or "non-author contributor" (defined in [1]), which denotes someone who has made a contribution to the OpenRSP project but has not been given the status of author.

* We use the following guideline to assess whether a contribution (or a collection of contributions) would qualify someone to be an OpenRSP author: "Providing more than a minimal contribution to either software requirement and design, software construction or software maintenance, or contributions involving combinations of these categories that taken together are more than minimal”. The exact nature of this threshold is currently defined with further specificity but is intended to be formed by practice.

* Any contribution which does not pass the threshold for granting status as author, as that threshold is described in the previous point, nevertheless makes the person who made it a contributor.

* If several contributions have been made by one person, then all such contributions should be considered together for the purposes of considering granting of status as an OpenRSP author.

* The OpenRSP authors pledge to try to become aware of candidates eligible for status as non-author contributor in the event that such candidates were not identified by other procedures.

## Process for deciding if a proposed new author should be approved as an author

* All authors are responsible for keeping their electronic mail contact information (as visible to the other authors) up to date and will be assumed to be reachable in this manner for the purposes of the communication described in this section.

* An existing author may nominate a person or persons for consideration as author, and a non-author may nominate themselves for consideration as author.

* Such a nomination must be communicated in writing to all of the present authors, but it is sufficient to at first communicate it to one of the present authors. That author is then responsible for notifying all present authors in a timely manner and for handling the rest of the author status determination process.

* The principal and preferred way to make such a nomination is to open a pull request to the “master” branch of the project where the AUTHORS.md file is amended to include the name of the nominated author (or to include such a change in a pull request containing other changes - such changes may typically be contributions that may qualify for author status). An author reviewing such a pull request is then responsible for handling that author status determination process.

* Once such a nomination is communicated to all the present authors, then if a consensus that the proposed author should definitely be granted or definitely not be granted status as author cannot be reached in a timely manner, or if any of the present authors at any point in time communicates that he or she wishes that the matter should be voted upon, the author responsible for the process must organize a call for votes among all the present authors to consider the nomination. This call for votes must be communicated to and its means of reply must be accessible to all authors, and must contain a question to the effect of “Do you approve or disapprove the proposal of granting status as author of OpenRSP to person A?”, where “person A” is the person nominated for consideration as author.

* Once such a call for votes has been communicated, the present authors must respond with their vote within two weeks and such a vote is final once submitted. An author who has not responded within this time will be counted as not voting on that proposal.

* If the majority of authors who voted on a given proposal (i.e. more than 50% of the authors who voted) approved the granting of author status to a proposed author, then that proposed author is offered status as author. If the vote was tied or a majority disapproved the granting of author status, then that proposed author is not offered status as author. The minimum total number of votes required for such a decision to be valid is three (3). If the number of votes cast is smaller than this minimum number, the proposed author is not offered status as author.

* Each author is entitled to know every other voting author's decision to approve or disapprove the granting of status as author to a proposed author, but no information about a voting author's such decision is to be given without that author's consent to a non-author (including the proposed author).

* The vote can be ended before the author's one week vote deadline and a decision made immediately if the outcome of the vote cannot be changed by the votes of authors who have not yet voted.

* In the case where a non-author was nominated by someone else than themselves, there is no obligation to notify a prospective author that they were nominated for author status, and there is also no obligation to tell a prospective author nominated by someone else that they were found to be not approved for status as author.

* The OpenRSP authors reserve the right to refrain from considering requests for consideration of granting author status to a person if such a request is frivolous or made with a vexatious motive.

## Process for ceasing to be an author and resulting transfer of rights

* Someone who wishes to cease to be an author (hereafter the "prospective non-author") can initiate this process by submitting a pull request (hereafter “the cessation pull request”) to the "master" branch containing a signed commit which documents this intention. 

* The prospective non-author must relinquish the copyright to their part of the work contained in OpenRSP to the OpenRSP project. A statement to this effect must be communicated in the cessation pull request.

* Upon acceptance and merging of the cessation pull request, the author cessation is considered to have taken place.


## Process for deciding other (non-author status) matters

* The process outlined above for deciding authorship status can also be used (but does not have to be used) for deciding other (non-author status) matters if such use does not require other process forms, and the matter at hand would then be substituted as appropriate in the description of the process outlined in point 2. An example of a situation which requires other process forms would be a license change proposal.
