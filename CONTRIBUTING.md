## Statement of inclusivity

Participants in the OpenRSP project (henceforth "the project") pledge to adhere to an intention to act in an inclusive and welcoming manner towards other participants in the project and towards anyone wishing to become a participant in the project. This manner of conduct includes, but is not necessarily limited to, that which is described in the project's Code of Conduct referenced at the beginning of this document. Pledging to intend to act in this manner is a prerequisite for becoming a participant in the project.

## Responsibilites when contributing code to the project

Any person who submits changes to the OpenRSP repository, by opening a pull request or by other means, is responsible for and must confirm that they have taken the necessary steps to achieve the following:

* Ensure that every person who contributed to the contents of the submitted changes understands and agrees with 1) the contribution guidelines in this file, 2) the documents concerning contribution and authorship topics linked to herein and 3) terms dictated by the license (referenced at the beginning of this document) under which OpenRSP is released, and that every such person authorizes such submission under these terms.
* Communicate to the OpenRSP authors the names and contact information of every person who contributed to the submitted changes if such persons do not already have status as authors of OpenRSP.
* Ensure that none of the contents of the submitted changes are licensed under terms which conflict with OpenRSP's license terms.

## Status categories associated with the project

Making an accepted contribution to the master branch of OpenRSP - typically achieved upon the acceptance and completion of a merge following a pull request having the master branch as the target branch - grants status as an OpenRSP "contributor" to those that produced this contribution, without any further conditions for such approval, but does not automatically grant status as an OpenRSP "author". The process by which one may become an OpenRSP author is described in the "Authorship status and process for approval as OpenRSP author", which is referenced at the beginning of this document and which contains further clarifications of the categories of "author" and "contributor". The preferred way to initiate a request for consideration as author is to amend the AUTHORS.md file in a pull request with the names of the persons for which one wishes this petitioning process to be initiated.
